* Cybernautical & Political Compass

  "The Fully-Augmented Dirt-Cheap Luxury Super-Empowered Network/Agent
  Cybernautical & Political Compass"

** WTF Is This?

   This political compass attempts to place various tools and
   practices on an axis of voluntary/involuntary and sharing/hiding
   activities.

   *Why fully-augmented?* Because augmentation is better than
   automation.  These words may often refer to the same thing and
   automation is often just the implementation of augmentation, but
   the key difference is putting the capabilities of agents and the
   amplification of those capabilities front and center in the design
   and implementation of technologies.

   *Why dirt-cheap luxury?* Because unimaginably advanced technology
   should be available to all.  Or as [[https://goo.gl/8z8Nx5][Jeremy Rifkin puts it]] "A legion
   of prosumers is producing and sharing 3D printed products at
   near-zero marginal cost on the collaborative commons."

   *Why super-empowered network/agent* This turn of phrase is more or
   less a nod to [[https://goo.gl/GrwAQ7][Kevin Carson's "Desktop Regulatory State"]], but it
   also stands alone well in explaining itself.

   *Why 'cybernautical'?* Cybernetics is the scientific/technological
   discipline concerned with regulatory systems.  The cybernetic agent
   is a node of autonomous control.  Tools and practices that expand
   sphere of options for agents, and networks of cooperating or
   coordinating agents, to control their environments and theirselves
   with respect to environments, are a major interest of cybernetics.

   "Cybernaut" is a somewhat whimsical term for the autonomous agent
   as an explorer and changer of the world.  "Cybernautical compass"
   is a play on "nautical compass", as the steerer of his/her own
   course may find useful.

   *Why political?* Because we live in a world of conflicting
   interests in which flesh-and-blood human beings must consider their
   well-being and the well-being of their families and extended
   networks of solidarity.  The political exists as long as there are
   conflicts over what is right, and what actions serve rightful ends.

   A world in which conflicts are interest are addressed peacefully
   and voluntarily is a non-political world.  That world also exists
   today but much work needs to be done for it to prevail as the main
   mode of global and local human organization.
